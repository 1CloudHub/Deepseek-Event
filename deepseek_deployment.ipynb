    "This below code snippet imports the necessary libraries and sets up the execution role for Amazon SageMaker to interact with Hugging Face models. It performs the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imports**:\n",
    "   - `json`: To handle JSON data.\n",
    "   - `sagemaker`: The SageMaker Python SDK to interact with AWS SageMaker services.\n",
    "   - `boto3`: AWS SDK for Python, used for interacting with AWS services like IAM (Identity and Access Management).\n",
    "   - `HuggingFaceModel`: A class from SageMaker to deploy Hugging Face models.\n",
    "   - `get_huggingface_llm_image_uri`: A helper function to retrieve the appropriate Docker image URI for Hugging Face models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Execution Role Retrieval**:\n",
    "   - The code first attempts to get the SageMaker execution role using `sagemaker.get_execution_role()`, which allows SageMaker to access required resources.\n",
    "   - If the role cannot be retrieved (e.g., when the script is run outside of SageMaker), it uses `boto3` to query IAM and fetch the `Arn` (Amazon Resource Name) for the `sagemaker_execution_role`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that the script can dynamically determine the required IAM role, whether running within a SageMaker notebook instance or an external environment.\n"

       "[{'generated_text': \"You are on a game show with three doors. Behind one door is a car; behind the other two are goats. You pick a door. The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the remaining doors, revealing a goat. You are given the choice to stick with your original pick or switch to the other unopened door. What should you do to maximize your chances of winning, and why? Use probability concepts to explain.\\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out this probability problem from the game show. It's called the Monty Hall problem, right? Let me recall what it's about.\\n\\nOkay, there are three doors: one has a car, the other two have goats. I pick a door, say door number 1. Then the host, who knows what's behind each door, opens another door, say door number 3, revealing a goat. Now, the host asks me if I want to stick with my original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door, door number 2. What should I do?\\n\\nHmm, I've heard conflicting things about this. Some people say you should stick with your first choice, and some say you should switch. I need to really think through the probabilities here.\\n\\nLet me start by outlining the possibilities. Initially, before any doors are opened, the chance that the car is behind each door is equal. So, the probability is 1/3 for each door. That makes sense because there's only one car and two goats.\\n\\nNow, I pick door number 1. At this point, I believe there's a 1/3 chance the car is behind door 1, and a 2/3 chance it's behind one of the other two doors, either door 2 or door 3. That's a key point.\\n\\nThe host then opens door number 3, revealing a goat. So, door 3 is definitely a goat. Now, I have the option to switch to door 2 or stay with door 1. I need to figure out which has a higher probability of hiding the car.\\n\\nWait, if I initially chose door 1 with a 1/3 chance, and the host revealed that door 3 is a goat, does that affect the probability of door 1 still being the car? I think it doesn't change door 1's probability because the host was going to open a goat door regardless. So, door 1 remains at 1/3.\\n\\nIf door 1 is 1/3, then what about door 2? Since door 3 is revealed to have a goat, the probabilities of door 2 must account for the remaining probability. Initially, door 2 had a 1/3 chance of the car, and door 3 had a 1/3 chance as well. But door 3 is now known to have a goat, so its probability drops to zero. Therefore, the probability that door 2 has the car should increase.\\n\\nLet me calculate that. If door 1 was originally 1/3, and the host reveals door 3 as a goat, the 1/3 probability that was originally split between door 2 and door 3 is now entirely on door 2 because door 3 is eliminated. So, door 2's probability goes from 1/3 to 2/3.\\n\\nTherefore, door 2 now has a 2/3 chance of having the car, while door 1 remains at 1/3. So, switching would give me a higher probability of winning the car.\\n\\nWait, another way to think about it is by enumerating all possible scenarios. Suppose the car is behind door 1:\\n\\n1. I pick door 1. Host opens door 2 or 3, both goats.\\n2. I can switch to either 2 or 3, but both are goats.\\n\\nIf the car is behind door 2:\\n\\n3. I pick door 1. Host must open door 3 (goat), so switching gets me the car.\\n4. Similarly, if the car was behind door 3:\\n\\n5. I pick door 1. Host opens door 2, which is a goat, so switching to door 3 gets me the car.\\n\\nWait, hold on. Wait, actually. Let me do this more carefully.\\n\\nThere are three possibilities for the car:\\n\\nCase 1: Car is behind door 1. Probability 1/3.\\n\\nCase 2: Car behind door 2. Probability 1/3.\\n\\nCase 3: Car behind door 3. Probability 1/3.\\n\\nIf I pick door 1:\\n\\n- Case 1: Host can open door 2 or 3, both goats. If I switch, I lose.\\n\\n- Case 2: Host has to open door 3 (goat). If I switch, I go to door 2, which has the car. So, I win.\\n\\n- Case 3: Host has to open door 2 (goat). If I switch, I go to door 3, which has the car. I win.\\n\\nWait, so in two out of the three cases, switching leads me to the car. Only in one case, where my original choice was correct, does switching make me lose. Therefore, the probability of winning by switching is 2/3, compared to 1/3 if I stick with my original choice.\\n\\nThat makes sense. So, in simpler terms, my initial choice had a 1/3 chance, but once the host reveals a goat, switching effectively gives me two chances out of three.\\n\\nAnother way to visualize it is through hypotheticals. Imagine playing the game 300 times. If I stick with my original choice, about 100 times (1/3) I'll have the car, because each choice is independently 1/3. But if I switch every time, in the 200 times the car was behind the other doors, I win. So, 200 wins, 100 losses. Therefore, switching gives me a better success rate.\\n\\nI was also thinking that the host's knowledge might affect the probabilities. Since he knows where the car is, he always avoids opening the door with the car. So, when he opens a door, he gives me some information. That information slightly shifts the probabilities in favor of switching.\\n\\nSo, in conclusion, by switching doors after the host reveals a goat, I effectively increase my chances of winning from 1/3 to 2/3. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to switch.\\n\\nWait, just to double confirm, let me think about if the host didn't know where the car was. If he opens a random door, sometimes he might reveal the car, and in that case, the game wouldn't make sense. But in this case, the host is intentionally opening a goat door, which changes the probability.\\n\\nSo, yes, my original reasoning holds: switching is better because it captures the 2/3 probability that the car isn't behind my initial choice.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nYou should switch doors to maximize your chances of winning, which are \\\\boxed{\\\\dfrac{2}{3}}.\\n</think>\\n\\nInitially, there are three doors with equal probability of hiding the car. When you choose one door, the probability that the car is behind your chosen door is 1/3. Consequently, the probability that the car is behind one of the other two doors is 2/3.\\n\\nAfter the host opens one of the remaining doors, revealing a goat, the probability distribution changes. The door you initially chose retains its 1/3 chance of having the car. However, the remaining unopened door now absorbs the 2/3 probability because the host's action provides information that effectively shifts the probability.\\n\\nTo detail this further, consider the three possible cases for the car:\\n1. If the car is behind your initial choice, switching will make you lose.\\n2. If the car is behind one of the other doors, switching will make you win.\\n\\nSince the car is twice as likely to be behind one of the other doors, switching doors gives you a 2/3 chance of winning the car.\\n\\n### Final Answer\\nYou should switch doors to maximize your chances of winning, which are \\\\boxed{\\\\dfrac{2}{3}}.\"}]"
